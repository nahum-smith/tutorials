    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Fool'
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players == team)
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = team.slice()
    // one way
    team2[1] = 'love-me'
    console.log(team, team2)
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(team2)
    team3[1] = 'questions'
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...team3]
    team4[3] = 'el hombre'
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    console.log(team, team2, team3, team4)
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
